Week 1      Nov.23rd to Nov.29th
==============================================================================================

- I'm planning to write weekly logs related to the development of this project. These logs are
  meant help me grow as a developer in multiple aspects.

- One aspect is the ability to articulate my decisions regarding design, functionality, or changes
  as a Senior Software Engineer would. I plan to go in-depth about my train of thought being most decisions.

- Another aspect is to help myself develop the design mentality of developer, specifically regarding documentation,
  reporting, etc. For example, There will be another directory in each Phase directory which will house documentation
  for each Phase if necessary. This phase will house diagrams of the planning and design for this application. From the
  look and feel to the relational database diagram. During the Development phase the diagrams will most likely consist
  of use cases and such.

- The last aspect is to reinforce my discipline and consistency. Knowing there's a logs for myself to complete on the Saturday
  of that week will help me stay consistent. After all, I want to show progress right?

- I also plan to try my best in implementing Agile methodologies into this project throughout its development cycle as a way
  to showcase my capabilities in them.

- if you've read all of this, thank you for spending your time here. I hope you have a great rest of your morning, afternoon, evening,
  and night.
