==============================================================================================
Week 4
==============================================================================================

- You might notice that the week dates aren't at the top of this "weekly" recap. The main reason
  as to why is simple: I got sick, then the holidays and work happen and this project got away
  from me. But I'm back to tackle it! 

- During that time I did stay somewhat consistent, and ended up finishing the Figma mock-up for what
  the UI of the application will look like. You can find the link to it in the Diagram directory in the file
  "TrainHard Mock-up UI" or within the readme.

- In a personal note, I'm happy I took the time to design it, because it allowed me to place a vision
  of the application which will help speed up the process when implementing the frontend, but also gave me
  an understanding of how the user will interact with the system. It made me think of features and functionalities
  that might be necessary without even realizing it. for example, I was so focused on how the database and data would
  be handled, I never even thought about what the creation outline would look like both in UI terms or in the backend.

- For now that about it, but I'll be going back to the weekly basis for this project, especially considering
  I will begin implementation this upcoming week. I'll be starting with the backend.

- If you've read through all of this, then thank you and I hope you have a great morning, afternoon, evening and night.
