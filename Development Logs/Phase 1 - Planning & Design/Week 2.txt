Week 2      Nov.30th to Dec.6th
==============================================================================================

- Hello! and Happy Holidays, thank you for checking this log out. This week was centered around
 improvement and growth. I researched the tech stack I plan to build the project with, the core functionalities
I want the application to have, and learned the C4Model for modeling software application.
(I should preface, client in this case is the business TrainHard Coaching).

- I did some researched on the technology I wanted to use for this project. My research was mainly influenced by
  functionalities outline by the client, the scale of the client's business, the scalability of the technology
  in case the business itself scales, and the programming paradigms that best fit what the client is looking for.

- I was on the fence between micro-services and monolith as the design for the application.I love micro-services,
  while the structure can be costly, they're greatly future-proof as they are easily scalable, and easily maintained
  since they are separate from one another. However, I decided in monolith. I came to this decision by stepping out
  of my shoes as a developer, and analyzing the business and what it needed rather than what I wanted to build. TrainHard
  Coaching has a large growing customer base, but the actual users will be the small team of coaches. Its also one location (for now)
  so for the time being its only one location, and a few devices that will actually require access to the application.

- However, I believe I might have found a solution that future me can take advantage of if the business does scale in a 
  way where microservices will work better. I chose Django for the backend technology. the first reason for this is because Headspace
  utilizes this technology for their API's and backends (and I would love to work there someday). Second, the modularity of the
  framework as a whole can help simplify the switch from monolith to microservices. I also liked how its structure was
  (in a way) like a microservice structure. You build applications, which then interact with one another, and each application has
  one responsibility, no more than that. This makes the code extremely easy to keep organized.

- As for the frontend framework, I'm still on the fence. I know React, and love its approach...but I also fell in love
  with the simplicity of Svelte. I have decided on using Tailwind CSS, but I'll work with React in mind until it comes time
  to actually implement the frontend. 

- Now, on to the diagrams. I learned the C4Model this week, which is a much more comprehensive and structured way to diagram
  one's software application. You can learn more at C4Model.com, but essentially you break up your application into 4 layers:
  System Context, Containers, Components, and Class (the 4 C's, get it?). System Context is the absolute most abstract way of 
  viewing your application. Then you "zoom in and see a more descriptive, but still abstract version of your application. Finally,
  Components are what make up your application, I think of them as the objects (like in Object-Oriented Programming). the Class layer
  is then the classes/code that make up your Components...but even the website recommends not including it in your diagrams since it can
  lead to confusion or redundancy.

- In general, the diagramming of your application in the C4Model should mimick, if not be very similar to your rpojects structure within
  and IDE. You have your parent directory (System Context), then the directories that divide it into frontend and backend perhaps (Containers),
  and then your objects (Components).

- I apologize for the length of this, but I guess they might get longer since these logs are meant to house my thoughts through development
  and the decisions I've made. Anyways, you can find some of the diagrams in the subsequent directory in this Phase.

- That's all for this week, and if you've read all of this, I hope you have a great morning, afternoon, evening, and night.
